.. function:: SplitCIFAR100(n_experiences: int, first_exp_with_half_classes: bool = False, return_task_id=False, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, train_transform=_default_cifar100_train_transform, eval_transform=_default_cifar100_eval_transform)

   Creates a CL scenario using the CIFAR100 dataset.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of
   scenario are "Class Incremental", "New Classes", etc. By default,
   an equal amount of classes will be assigned to each experience.

   This generator doesn't force a choice on the availability of task labels,
   a choice that is left to the user (see the `return_task_id` parameter for
   more info on task labels).

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label.

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of incremental experiences in the current
       scenario. The value of this parameter should be a divisor of 100 if
       first_task_with_half_classes is False, a divisor of 50 otherwise.
   :param first_exp_with_half_classes: A boolean value that indicates if a
       first pretraining batch containing half of the classes should be used.
       If it's True, a pretraining experience with half of the classes (50 for
       cifar100) is used. If this parameter is False no pretraining task
       will be used, and the dataset is simply split into a the number of
       experiences defined by the parameter n_experiences. Default to False.
   :param return_task_id: if True, a progressive task id is returned for every
       experience. If False, all experiences will have a task ID of 0.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order. If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class
       order. If non-None, ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default test transformation
       will be used.

   :returns: A properly initialized :class:`NCScenario` instance.


.. function:: SplitCIFAR110(n_experiences: int, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, train_transform=_default_cifar100_train_transform, eval_transform=_default_cifar100_eval_transform) -> NCScenario

   Creates a CL scenario using both the CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 datasets.

   If the datasets are not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store them in the data folder.

   The CIFAR10 dataset is used to create the first experience, while the
   remaining `n_experiences-1` experiences will be created from CIFAR100.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of
   scenario are "Class Incremental", "New Classes", etc. By default,
   an equal amount of classes will be assigned to each experience.

   This generator will apply a task label "0" to all experiences.

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label (always "0" for this specific
   benchmark).

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences for the entire scenario.
       The first experience will contain the entire CIFAR10 dataset, while the
       other n-1 experiences will be obtained from CIFAR100.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order ONLY for the incremental part, which is based on cifar100. The
       classes must be in range 0-99.
       If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class order for
       the incremental batches on cifar100. If non-None, ``seed`` parameter
       will be ignored. Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default test transformation
       will be used.

   :returns: A properly initialized :class:`NCScenario` instance.
