.. function:: SplitCIFAR10(n_experiences: int, first_exp_with_half_classes: bool = False, return_task_id=False, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, train_transform=_default_cifar10_train_transform, eval_transform=_default_cifar10_eval_transform) -> NCScenario

   Creates a CL scenario using the CIFAR10 dataset.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of
   scenario are "Class Incremental", "New Classes", etc. By default,
   an equal amount of classes will be assigned to each experience.

   This generator doesn't force a choice on the availability of task labels,
   a choice that is left to the user (see the `return_task_id` parameter for
   more info on task labels).

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label.

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences in the current scenario.
       The value of this parameter should be a divisor of 10 if
       `first_task_with_half_classes` is False, a divisor of 5 otherwise.
   :param first_exp_with_half_classes: A boolean value that indicates if a
       first pretraining step containing half of the classes should be used.
       If it's True, the first experience will use half of the classes (5 for
       cifar10). If this parameter is False, no pretraining step will be
       used and the dataset is simply split into a the number of experiences
       defined by the parameter n_experiences. Defaults to False.
   :param return_task_id: if True, a progressive task id is returned for every
       experience. If False, all experiences will have a task ID of 0.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order. If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class
       order. If not None, the ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default eval transformation
       will be used.

   :returns: A properly initialized :class:`NCScenario` instance.

   Creates a CL scenario using the CIFAR100 dataset.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of incremental experiences in the current
       scenario. The value of this parameter should be a divisor of 100 if
       first_task_with_half_classes is False, a divisor of 50 otherwise.
   :param first_exp_with_half_classes: A boolean value that indicates if a
       first pretraining batch containing half of the classes should be used.
       If it's True, a pretraining experience with half of the classes (50 for
       cifar100) is used. If this parameter is False no pretraining task
       will be used, and the dataset is simply split into a the number of
       experiences defined by the parameter n_experiences. Default to False.
   :param return_task_id: if True, a progressive task id is returned for every
       experience. If False, all experiences will have a task ID of 0.

       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order. If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class
       order. If non-None, ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different

   Creates a CL scenario using both the CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 datasets.

   If the datasets are not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store them in the data folder.

   The CIFAR10 dataset is used to create the first experience, while the
   remaining `n_experiences-1` experiences will be created from CIFAR100.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of
   scenario are "Class Incremental", "New Classes", etc. By default,
   an equal amount of classes will be assigned to each experience.

   This generator will apply a task label "0" to all experiences.

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label (always "0" for this specific
   benchmark).

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences for the entire scenario.
       The first experience will contain the entire CIFAR10 dataset, while the
       other n-1 experiences will be obtained from CIFAR100.

       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order ONLY for the incremental part, which is based on cifar100. The
       classes must be in range 0-99.
       If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class order for

       The value of this parameter should be a divisor of 10.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param rotations_list: A list of rotations values in degrees (from -180 to
       180) used to define the rotations. The rotation specified in position
       0 of the list will be applied to the task 0, the rotation specified in
       position 1 will be applied to task 1 and so on.
       If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the rotations.
       If non-None, ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data
       after the random rotation, e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a
       concatenation of different transformations (see torchvision.transform
       documentation for a comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.

       If no transformation is passed, the default test transformation
       will be used.

   :returns: A properly initialized :class:`NCScenario` instance.


.. function:: SplitOmniglot(n_experiences: int, return_task_id=False, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, train_transform=_default_omniglot_train_transform, eval_transform=_default_omniglot_eval_transform)

   Creates a CL scenario using the OMNIGLOT dataset.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   The returned scenario will return experiences containing all patterns of a
   subset of classes, which means that each class is only seen "once".
   This is one of the most common scenarios in the Continual Learning
   literature. Common names used in literature to describe this kind of
   scenario are "Class Incremental", "New Classes", etc.

   By default, an equal amount of classes will be assigned to each experience.
   OMNIGLOT consists of 1623 classes, which means that the number of
   experiences can be 1, 3, 541, 1623.

   This generator doesn't force a choice on the availability of task labels,
   a choice that is left to the user (see the `return_task_id` parameter for
   more info on task labels).

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label.

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of incremental experiences in the current
       scenario. The value of this parameter should be a divisor of 10.
   :param return_task_id: if True, a progressive task id is returned for every
       experience. If False, all experiences will have a task ID of 0.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param fixed_class_order: A list of class IDs used to define the class
       order. If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the class
       order. If non-None, ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data,
       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a
       comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.

       e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a concatenation of different
       transformations (see torchvision.transform documentation for a

   Creates a Permuted Omniglot scenario.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   Random pixel permutations are used to permute the Omniglot images in
   ``n_experiences`` different manners. This means that each experience is
   composed of all the original 1623 Omniglot classes, but the pixel in the
   images are permuted in a different way.

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,
   `train_stream` and `test_stream`, which can be iterated to obtain
   training and test :class:`Experience`. Each Experience contains the
   `dataset` and the associated task label.

   A progressive task label, starting from "0", is applied to each experience.

   The scenario API is quite simple and is uniform across all scenario
   generators. It is recommended to check the tutorial of the "benchmark" API,
   which contains usage examples ranging from "basic" to "advanced".

   :param n_experiences: The number of experiences (tasks) in the current
       scenario. It indicates how many different permutations of the Omniglot
       dataset have to be created.
   :param seed: A valid int used to initialize the random number generator.
       Can be None.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to the training data
       before the random permutation, e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a
       concatenation of different transformations (see torchvision.transform
       documentation for a comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default train transformation
       will be used.
   :param eval_transform: The transformation to apply to the test data
       before the random permutation, e.g. a random crop, a normalization or a
       concatenation of different transformations (see torchvision.transform
       documentation for a comprehensive list of possible transformations).
       If no transformation is passed, the default test transformation
       will be used.

   Creates a Rotated Omniglot scenario.

   If the dataset is not present in the computer, this method will
   automatically download and store it.

   Random angles are used to rotate the Omniglot images in ``n_experiences``
   different manners. This means that each experience is
   composed of all the original 1623 Omniglot classes, but each image is
   rotated in a different way.

   The scenario instance returned by this method will have two fields,

       0 of the list will be applied to the task 0, the rotation specified in
       position 1 will be applied to task 1 and so on.
       If None, value of ``seed`` will be used to define the rotations.
       If non-None, ``seed`` parameter will be ignored.
       Defaults to None.
