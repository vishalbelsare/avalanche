.. py:class:: MiniImageNetDataset(imagenet_path: Union[str, Path], split: Literal['all', 'train', 'val', 'test'] = 'all', resize_to: Union[int, Tuple[int, int]] = 84)

   Bases: :class:`torch.utils.data.dataset.Dataset`

   The MiniImageNet dataset.

   This implementation is based on the one from
   https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/mini-imagenet-tools. Differently from that,
   this class doesn't rely on a pre-generated mini imagenet folder. Instead,
   this will use the original ImageNet folder by resizing images on-the-fly.

   The list of included files are the ones defined in the CSVs taken from the
   aforementioned repository. Those CSVs are generated by Ravi and Larochelle.
   See the linked repository for more details.

   Exactly as happens with the torchvision :class:`ImageNet` class, textual
   class labels (wnids) such as "n02119789", "n02102040", etc. are mapped to
   numerical labels based on their ascending order.

   All the fields found in the torchvision implementation of the ImageNet
   dataset (`wnids`, `wnid_to_idx`, `classes`, `class_to_idx`) are available.

   Creates an instance of the Mini ImageNet dataset.

   This dataset allows to obtain the whole dataset or even only specific
   splits. Beware that, when using a split different that "all", the
   returned dataset will contain patterns of a subset of the 100 classes.
   This happens because MiniImagenet was created with the idea of training,
   validating and testing on a disjoint set of classes.

   This implementation uses the filelists provided by
   https://github.com/yaoyao-liu/mini-imagenet-tools, which are the ones
   generated by Ravi and Larochelle (see the linked repo for more details).

   :param imagenet_path: The path to the imagenet folder. This has to be
       the path to the full imagenet 2012 folder (plain, not resized).
       Only the "train" folder will be used. Because of this, passing the
       path to the imagenet 2012 "train" folder is also allowed.
   :param split: The split to obtain. Defaults to "all". Valid values are
       "all", "train", "val" and "test".
   :param resize_to: The size of the output images. Can be an `int` value
       or a tuple of two ints. When passing a single `int` value, images
       will be resized by forcing as 1:1 aspect ratio. Defaults to 84,
       which means that images will have size 84x84.

   .. attribute:: imagenet_path
      

      The path to the "train" folder of full imagenet 2012 directory.


   .. attribute:: split
      :annotation: :Literal['all', 'train', 'val', 'test']

      The required split.


   .. attribute:: resize_to
      :annotation: :Tuple[int, int]

      The size of the output images, as a two ints tuple.


   .. attribute:: image_paths
      :annotation: :List[str] = []

      The paths to images.


   .. attribute:: targets
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      The class labels for the patterns. Aligned with the image_paths field.


   .. attribute:: wnids
      :annotation: :List[str] = []

      The list of wnids (the textual class labels, such as "n02119789").


   .. attribute:: wnid_to_idx
      :annotation: :Dict[str, int]

      A dictionary mapping wnids to numerical labels in range [0, 100).


   .. attribute:: classes
      :annotation: :List[Tuple[str, ...]] = []

      A list mapping numerical labels (the element index) to a tuple of human
      readable categories. For instance:
      ('great grey owl', 'great gray owl', 'Strix nebulosa').


   .. attribute:: class_to_idx
      :annotation: :Dict[str, int]

      A dictionary mapping each string of the tuples found in the classes 
      field to their numerical label. That is, this dictionary contains the 
      inverse mapping of classes field.
