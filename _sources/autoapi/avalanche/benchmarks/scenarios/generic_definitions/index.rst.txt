.. py:class:: IExperience

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TScenarioStream]`

   Definition of an experience. An experience contains a set of patterns
   which has become available at a particular time instant. The content and
   size of an Experience is defined by the specific benchmark that creates the
   IExperience instance.

   For instance, an experience of a New Classes scenario will contain all
   patterns belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. An
   experience of a New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously
   seen classes.

   Experiences of Single Incremental Task (a.k.a. task-free) scenarios are
   usually called "batches" while in Multi Task scenarios an Experience is
   usually associated to a "task". Finally, in a Multi Incremental Task
   scenario the Experience may be composed by patterns from different tasks.

   .. attribute:: origin_stream
      :annotation: :TScenarioStream

      A reference to the original stream from which this experience was obtained.


   .. attribute:: scenario
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the scenario.


   .. attribute:: current_experience
      :annotation: :int

      This is an incremental, 0-indexed, value used to keep track of the position 
      of current experience in the original stream.

      Beware that this value only describes the experience position in the 
      original stream and may be unrelated to the order in which the strategy will
      encounter experiences.


   .. method:: dataset(self) -> AvalancheDataset
      :property:

      The dataset containing the patterns available in this experience.


   .. method:: task_labels(self) -> List[int]
      :property:

      This list will contain the unique task labels of the patterns contained
      in this experience. In the most common scenarios this will be a list
      with a single value. Note: for scenarios that don't produce task labels,
      a placeholder task label value like 0 is usually set to each pattern
      (see the description of the originating scenario for details).


   .. method:: task_label(self) -> int
      :property:

      The task label. This value will never have value "None". However,
      for scenarios that don't produce task labels a placeholder value like 0
      is usually set. Beware that this field is meant as a shortcut to obtain
      a unique task label: it assumes that only patterns labeled with a
      single task label are present. If this experience contains patterns from
      multiple tasks, accessing this property will result in an exception.



.. py:class:: IScenarioStream

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TExperience]`

   A scenario stream describes a sequence of incremental experiences.
   Experiences are described as :class:`IExperience` instances. They contain a
   set of patterns which has become available at a particular time instant
   along with any optional, scenario specific, metadata.

   Most scenario expose two different streams: the training stream and the test
   stream.

   .. attribute:: name
      :annotation: :str

      The name of the stream.


   .. attribute:: scenario
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the scenario this stream belongs to.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self: TScenarioStream, experience_idx: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> Union[TExperience, TScenarioStream]

      Gets an experience given its experience index (or a stream slice given
      the experience order).

      :param experience_idx: An int describing the experience index or an
          iterable/slice object describing a slice of this stream.
      :return: The Experience instance associated to the given experience
          index or a sliced stream instance.


   .. method:: __len__(self) -> int
