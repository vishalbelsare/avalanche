.. py:class:: IExperience

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TScenarioStream]`

   Definition of an experience. An experience contains a set of patterns
   which has become available at a particular time instant. The content and
   size of an Experience is defined by the specific benchmark that creates the
   IExperience instance.

   For instance, an experience of a New Classes scenario will contain all
   patterns belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. An
   experience of a New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously
   seen classes.

   Experiences of Single Incremental Task (a.k.a. task-free) scenarios are
   usually called "batches" while in Multi Task scenarios an Experience is
   usually associated to a "task". Finally, in a Multi Incremental Task
   scenario the Experience may be composed by patterns from different tasks.

   .. attribute:: origin_stream
      :annotation: :TScenarioStream

      A reference to the original stream from which this experience was obtained.


   .. attribute:: scenario
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the scenario.


   .. attribute:: current_experience
      :annotation: :int

      This is an incremental, 0-indexed, value used to keep track of the position 
      of current experience in the original stream.

      Beware that this value only describes the experience position in the 
      original stream and may be unrelated to the order in which the strategy will
      encounter experiences.


   .. method:: dataset(self) -> AvalancheDataset
      :property:

      The dataset containing the patterns available in this experience.


   .. method:: task_labels(self) -> List[int]
      :property:

      This list will contain the unique task labels of the patterns contained
      in this experience. In the most common scenarios this will be a list
      with a single value. Note: for scenarios that don't produce task labels,
      a placeholder task label value like 0 is usually set to each pattern
      (see the description of the originating scenario for details).


   .. method:: task_label(self) -> int
      :property:

      The task label. This value will never have value "None". However,
      for scenarios that don't produce task labels a placeholder value like 0
      is usually set. Beware that this field is meant as a shortcut to obtain
      a unique task label: it assumes that only patterns labeled with a
      single task label are present. If this experience contains patterns from
      multiple tasks, accessing this property will result in an exception.



.. data:: TExperience
   

   

.. data:: TScenario
   

   

.. py:class:: IScenarioStream

   Bases: :class:`Protocol[TScenario, TExperience]`

   A scenario stream describes a sequence of incremental experiences.
   Experiences are described as :class:`IExperience` instances. They contain a
   set of patterns which has become available at a particular time instant
   along with any optional, scenario specific, metadata.

   Most scenario expose two different streams: the training stream and the test
   stream.

   .. attribute:: name
      :annotation: :str

      The name of the stream.


   .. attribute:: scenario
      :annotation: :TScenario

      A reference to the scenario this stream belongs to.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self: TScenarioStream, step_idx: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> Union[TExperience, TScenarioStream]

      Gets an experience given its experience index (or a stream slice given
      the experience order).

      :param step_idx: An int describing the experience index or an
          iterable/slice object describing a slice of this stream.
      :return: The Experience instance associated to the given experience
          index or a sliced stream instance.


   .. method:: __len__(self) -> int



.. data:: TScenarioStream
   

   

.. data:: TGenericCLScenario
   

   

.. py:class:: GenericCLScenario(: TGenericCLScenario, original_train_dataset: TrainSet, original_test_dataset: TestSet, train_dataset: AvalancheDataset, test_dataset: AvalancheDataset, train_exps_patterns_assignment: Sequence[Sequence[int]], test_exps_patterns_assignment: Sequence[Sequence[int]], task_labels: Sequence[List[int]], pattern_train_task_labels: Sequence[int], pattern_test_task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, experience_factory: Callable[['GenericScenarioStream', int], TExperience] = None)

   Bases: :class:`Generic[TrainSet, TestSet, TExperience]`

   Base implementation of a Continual Learning scenario. A Continual Learning
   scenario is defined by a sequence of experiences (batches or tasks depending
   on the terminology), with each experience containing the training (or test)
   data that becomes available at a certain time instant.

   From a practical point of view, this means that we usually have to define
   two datasets (training and test), and some way to assign the patterns
   contained in these datasets to each experience.

   This assignment is usually made in children classes, with this class serving
   as the more general implementation. This class handles the most simple type
   of assignment: each experience is defined by a list of patterns (identified
   by their indexes) contained in that experience.

   Creates an instance of a Continual Learning scenario.

   The scenario is defined by the train and test datasets plus the
   assignment of patterns to experiences (batches/tasks).

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``train_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``test_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param train_exps_patterns_assignment: A list of experiences. Each
       experience is in turn defined by a list of integers describing the
       pattern index inside the training dataset.
   :param test_exps_patterns_assignment: A list of experiences. Each
       experience is in turn defined by a list of integers describing the
       pattern index inside the test dataset.
   :param task_labels: The mapping from experience IDs to task labels,
       usually as a list of integers.
   :param pattern_train_task_labels: The list of task labels of each
       pattern in the `train_dataset`.
   :param pattern_test_task_labels: The list of task labels of each
       pattern in the `test_dataset`.
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test
       set will be returned from test set related methods of the linked
       :class:`GenericExperience` instances. This also means that the
       ``test_exps_patterns_assignment`` parameter can be a single element
       or even an empty list (in which case, the full set defined by
       the ``test_dataset`` parameter will be returned). The returned
       task label for the complete test set will be the first element
       of the ``task_labels`` parameter. Defaults to False, which means
       that ```train_exps_patterns_assignment`` and
       ``test_exps_patterns_assignment`` parameters must describe an equal
       amount of experiences.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides the
       ``train/test_exps_patterns_assignment`` and ``task_labels``
       parameters. This is usually a dictionary containing data used to
       reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.
   :param experience_factory: If not None, a callable that, given the
       scenario instance and the experience ID, returns a experience
       instance. This parameter is usually used in subclasses (when
       invoking the super constructor) to specialize the experience class.
       Defaults to None, which means that the :class:`GenericExperience`
       constructor will be used.

   .. attribute:: original_train_dataset
      :annotation: :TrainSet

      The original training set. 


   .. attribute:: original_test_dataset
      :annotation: :TestSet

      The original test set. 


   .. attribute:: train_exps_patterns_assignment
      :annotation: :Sequence[Sequence[int]]

      A list containing which training patterns are assigned to each 
      experience. Patterns are identified by their id w.r.t. the dataset found
      in the train_dataset field. 


   .. attribute:: test_exps_patterns_assignment
      :annotation: :Sequence[Sequence[int]]

      A list containing which test patterns are assigned to each
      experience. Patterns are identified by their id w.r.t. the dataset found
      in the test_dataset field 


   .. attribute:: task_labels
      :annotation: :Sequence[List[int]]

      The task label of each experience.

      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The task label of each pattern in the training dataset. 


   .. attribute:: pattern_test_task_labels
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The task label of each pattern in the test dataset. 


   .. attribute:: complete_test_set_only
      :annotation: :bool

      If True, only the complete test set will be returned from experience
      instances.

      This flag is usually set to True in scenarios where having one separate
      test set aligned to each training experience is impossible or doesn't
      make sense from a semantic point of view.


   .. attribute:: n_experiences
      :annotation: :int

      The number of incremental experiences this scenario is made of. 


   .. attribute:: train_dataset
      :annotation: :AvalancheDataset

   .. attribute:: test_dataset
      :annotation: :AvalancheDataset

   .. attribute:: train_stream
      :annotation: :GenericScenarioStream[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]

      The stream used to obtain the training steps. This stream can be sliced
      in order to obtain a subset of this stream.


   .. attribute:: test_stream
      :annotation: :GenericScenarioStream[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]

      The stream used to obtain the test steps. This stream can be sliced
      in order to obtain a subset of this stream.

      Beware that, in certain scenarios, this stream may contain a single
      element. Check the ``complete_test_set_only`` field for more details.


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

      Gets the data needed to reproduce this experiment.

      This data can be stored using the pickle module or some other mechanism.
      It can then be loaded by passing it as the ``reproducibility_data``
      parameter in the constructor.

      Child classes should get the reproducibility dictionary from super class
      and then merge their custom data before returning it.

      :return: A dictionary containing the data needed to reproduce the
          experiment.


   .. method:: get_classes_timeline(self, current_experience: int)

      Returns the classes timeline for a this scenario.

      Given a step ID, this method returns the classes in this step,
      previously seen classes, the cumulative class list and a list
      of classes that will be encountered in next steps.

      :param current_experience: The reference step ID.
      :return: A tuple composed of four lists: the first list contains the
          IDs of classes in this step, the second contains IDs of classes seen
          in previous steps, the third returns a cumulative list of classes
          (that is, the union of the first two list) while the last one
          returns a list of classes that will be encountered in next steps.


   .. method:: classes_in_experience(self) -> Sequence[Set[int]]
      :property:

      A list that, for each experience (identified by its index/ID),
      stores a set of the (optionally remapped) IDs of classes of patterns
      assigned to that experience. 



.. py:class:: GenericScenarioStream(: TGenericScenarioStream, name: str, scenario: TGenericCLScenario, *, slice_ids: List[int] = None)

   Bases: :class:`Generic[TExperience, TGenericCLScenario]`, :class:`IScenarioStream[TGenericCLScenario, TExperience]`, :class:`Sequence[TExperience]`

   A scenario stream describes a sequence of incremental experiences.
   Experiences are described as :class:`IExperience` instances. They contain a
   set of patterns which has become available at a particular time instant
   along with any optional, scenario specific, metadata.

   Most scenario expose two different streams: the training stream and the test
   stream.

   Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

   .. attribute:: slice_ids
      :annotation: :Optional[List[int]]

      Describes which steps are contained in the current stream slice. 
      Can be None, which means that this object is the original stream. 


   .. method:: __len__(self) -> int

      Gets the number of steps this scenario it's made of.

      :return: The number of steps in this scenario.


   .. method:: __getitem__(self, exp_idx: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> Union[TExperience, TScenarioStream]

      Gets a step given its step index (or a stream slice given the step
      order).

      :param exp_idx: An int describing the step index or an iterable/slice
          object describing a slice of this stream.

      :return: The step instance associated to the given step index or
          a sliced stream instance.


   .. method:: _create_slice(self: TGenericScenarioStream, exps_slice: Union[int, slice, Iterable[int]]) -> TScenarioStream

      Creates a sliced version of this stream.

      In its base version, a shallow copy of this stream is created and
      then its ``slice_ids`` field is adapted.

      :param exps_slice: The slice to use.
      :return: A sliced version of this stream.



.. py:class:: AbstractExperience(: TExperience, origin_stream: TScenarioStream, current_experience: int, classes_in_this_exp: Sequence[int], previous_classes: Sequence[int], classes_seen_so_far: Sequence[int], future_classes: Optional[Sequence[int]])

   Bases: :class:`IExperience[TScenario, TScenarioStream]`, :class:`abc.ABC`

   Definition of a learning experience. A learning experience contains a set of
   patterns which has become available at a particular time instant. The
   content and size of an Experience is defined by the specific benchmark that
   creates the experience.

   For instance, an experience of a New Classes scenario will contain all
   patterns belonging to a subset of classes of the original training set. An
   experience of a New Instance scenario will contain patterns from previously
   seen classes.

   Experiences of Single Incremental Task (a.k.a. task-free) scenarios are
   usually called "batches" while in Multi Task scenarios an Experience is
   usually associated to a "task". Finally, in a Multi Incremental Task
   scenario the Experience may be composed by patterns from different tasks.

   Creates an instance of the abstract experience given the scenario
   stream, the current experience ID and data about the classes timeline.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this experience was
       obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current experience ID, as an integer.
   :param classes_in_this_exp: The list of classes in this experience.
   :param previous_classes: The list of classes in previous experiences.
   :param classes_seen_so_far: List of classes of current and previous
       experiences.
   :param future_classes: The list of classes of next experiences.

   .. attribute:: classes_in_this_experience
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The list of classes in this experience 


   .. attribute:: previous_classes
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      The list of classes in previous experiences 


   .. attribute:: classes_seen_so_far
      :annotation: :Sequence[int]

      List of classes of current and previous experiences 


   .. attribute:: future_classes
      :annotation: :Optional[Sequence[int]]

      The list of classes of next experiences 


   .. method:: task_label(self) -> int
      :property:

      The task label. This value will never have value "None". However,
      for scenarios that don't produce task labels a placeholder value like 0
      is usually set. Beware that this field is meant as a shortcut to obtain
      a unique task label: it assumes that only patterns labeled with a
      single task label are present. If this experience contains patterns from
      multiple tasks, accessing this property will result in an exception.



.. py:class:: GenericExperience(: TGenericExperience, origin_stream: GenericScenarioStream[TGenericExperience, TGenericCLScenario], current_experience: int)

   Bases: :class:`AbstractExperience[TGenericCLScenario, GenericScenarioStream[TGenericExperience, TGenericCLScenario]]`

   Definition of a learning experience based on a :class:`GenericCLScenario`
   instance.

   This experience implementation uses the generic experience-patterns
   assignment defined in the :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance. Instances of
   this class are usually obtained from a scenario stream.

   Creates an instance of a generic experience given the stream from this
   experience was taken and and the current experience ID.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this step was obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current step ID, as an integer.

   .. method:: _is_train(self)



.. function:: create_multi_dataset_generic_scenario(train_dataset_list: Sequence[SupportedDataset], test_dataset_list: Sequence[SupportedDataset], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of datasets and the respective task
   labels. Each training dataset will be considered as a separate training
   step. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the targets.

   When loading the datasets from a set of fixed filelist, consider using
   the :func:`create_generic_scenario_from_filelists` helper method instead.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of test datsets that must
   contain the same amount of datasets of the training list.
   Those pairs are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   Beware that pattern transformations must already be included in the
   datasets (when needed).

   :param train_dataset_list: A list of training datasets.
   :param test_dataset_list: A list of test datasets.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_dataset_list`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_dataset_list``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_dataset_list`` and
       ``test_dataset_list`` must contain the same amount of datasets.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_filelists(root: Union[str, Path], train_file_lists: Sequence[Union[str, Path]], test_file_lists: Union[Union[str, Path], Sequence[Union[str, Path]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given a list of filelists and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created for each filelist and each of
   those training datasets will be considered a separate training step.
   Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the targets.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list of filelists for the test
   datsets that must contain the same amount of elements of the training list.
   Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   This helper functions is the best shot when loading Caffe-style dataset
   based on filelists.

   :param root: The root path of the dataset.
   :param train_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the training patterns for each step.
   :param test_file_lists: A list of filelists describing the
       paths of the test patterns for each step.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_file_lists`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_file_lists``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Alternatively, can be a plain string or :class:`Path` object.
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_file_lists`` and
       ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

   :returns: A :class:`GenericCLScenario` instance.


.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_paths(train_list_of_files: Sequence[Sequence[FileAndLabel]], test_list_of_files: Union[Sequence[FileAndLabel], Sequence[Sequence[FileAndLabel]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given a sequence of lists of files. A separate
   dataset will be created for each list. Each of those training datasets
   will be considered a separate training step.

   This is very similar to `create_generic_scenario_from_filelists`, with the
   main difference being that `create_generic_scenario_from_filelists`
   accepts, for each step, a file list formatted in Caffe-style.
   On the contrary, this accepts a list of tuples where each tuple contains
   two elements: the full path to the pattern and its label.
   Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element describing the bounding
   box of the element to crop. This last bounding box may be useful when trying
   to extract the part of the image depicting the desired element.

   In its base form, this function accepts a list for the test datsets that
   must contain the same amount of elements of the training list.
   Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the "past", "cumulative"
   (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets. However, in certain Continual
   Learning scenarios only the concept of "complete" test set makes sense. In
   that case, the ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the
   parameter description for more info).

   :param train_list_of_files: A list of lists. Each list describes the paths
       and labels of patterns to include in that training step, as tuples. Each
       tuple must contain two elements: the full path to the pattern and its
       class label. Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element
       describing the bounding box to use for cropping (top, left, height,
       width).
   :param test_list_of_files: A list of lists. Each list describes the paths
       and labels of patterns to include in that test step, as tuples. Each
       tuple must contain two elements: the full path to the pattern and its
       class label. Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element
       describing the bounding box to use for cropping (top, left, height,
       width).
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_file_lists`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_file_lists``
       parameter must be list with a single element (the complete test set).
       Alternatively, can be a plain string or :class:`Path` object.
       Defaults to False, which means that ``train_file_lists`` and
       ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

.. function:: create_generic_scenario_from_tensors(train_data_x: Sequence[Any], train_data_y: Sequence[Sequence[SupportsInt]], test_data_x: Union[Any, Sequence[Any]], test_data_y: Union[Any, Sequence[Sequence[SupportsInt]]], task_labels: Sequence[int], complete_test_set_only: bool = False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None) -> GenericCLScenario

   Creates a generic scenario given lists of Tensors and the respective task
   labels. A separate dataset will be created from each Tensor pair (x + y)
   and each of those training datasets will be considered a separate
   training step. Contents of the datasets will not be changed, including the
   targets. Using this helper function is the lower level way to create a
   Continual Learning scenario. When possible, consider using higher level
   helpers.

   In its base form, the test lists must contain the same amount of elements of
   the training lists. Those pairs of datasets are then used to create the
   "past", "cumulative" (a.k.a. growing) and "future" test sets.
   However, in certain Continual Learning scenarios only the concept of
   "complete" test set makes sense. In that case, the
   ``complete_test_set_only`` should be set to True (see the parameter
   description for more info).

   :param train_data_x: A list of Tensors (one per step) containing the
       patterns of the training sets.
   :param train_data_y: A list of Tensors or int lists containing the
       labels of the patterns of the training sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``train_datasets_x``.
   :param test_data_x: A Tensor or a list of Tensors (one per step) containing
       the patterns of the test sets.
   :param test_data_y: A Tensor or a list of Tensors or int lists containing
       the labels of the patterns of the test sets. Must contain the same
       number of elements of ``test_datasets_x``.
   :param task_labels: A list of task labels. Must contain the same amount of
       elements of the ``train_datasets_x`` parameter. For
       Single-Incremental-Task (a.k.a. Task-Free) scenarios, this is usually
       a list of zeros. For Multi Task scenario, this is usually a list of
       ascending task labels (starting from 0).
   :param complete_test_set_only: If True, only the complete test set will
       be returned by the scenario. This means that the ``test_datasets_x`` and
       ``test_datasets_y`` parameters must be lists with a single element
       (the complete test set). Defaults to False, which means that
       ``train_file_lists`` and ``test_file_lists`` must contain the same
       amount of filelists paths.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

.. py:class:: NCScenario(train_dataset: TrainSet, test_dataset: TestSet, n_experiences: int, task_labels: bool, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None, fixed_class_order: Optional[Sequence[int]] = None, per_experience_classes: Optional[Dict[int, int]] = None, class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp: bool = False, class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp: bool = False, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)

   Bases: :class:`GenericCLScenario[TrainSet, TestSet, 'NCExperience']`, :class:`Generic[TrainSet, TestSet]`

   This class defines a "New Classes" scenario. Once created, an instance
   of this class can be iterated in order to obtain the step sequence
   under the form of instances of :class:`NCExperience`.

   This class can be used directly. However, we recommend using facilities like
   :func:`avalanche.benchmarks.generators.nc_scenario`.

   Creates a ``NCGenericScenario`` instance given the training and test
   Datasets and the number of steps.

   By default, the number of classes will be automatically detected by
   looking at the training Dataset ``targets`` field. Classes will be
   uniformly distributed across ``n_experiences`` unless a
   ``per_experience_classes`` argument is specified.

   The number of classes must be divisible without remainder by the number
   of steps. This also applies when the ``per_experience_classes`` argument
   is not None.

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``train_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``test_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param n_experiences: The number of steps.
   :param task_labels: If True, each step will have an ascending task
       label. If False, the task label will be 0 for all the steps.
   :param shuffle: If True, the class order will be shuffled. Defaults to
       True.
   :param seed: If shuffle is True and seed is not None, the class order
       will be shuffled according to the seed. When None, the current
       PyTorch random number generator state will be used.
       Defaults to None.
   :param fixed_class_order: If not None, the class order to use (overrides
       the shuffle argument). Very useful for enhancing
       reproducibility. Defaults to None.
   :param per_experience_classes: Is not None, a dictionary whose keys are
       (0-indexed) step IDs and their values are the number of classes
       to include in the respective steps. The dictionary doesn't
       have to contain a key for each step! All the remaining steps
       will contain an equal amount of the remaining classes. The
       remaining number of classes must be divisible without remainder
       by the remaining number of steps. For instance,
       if you want to include 50 classes in the first step
       while equally distributing remaining classes across remaining
       steps, just pass the "{0: 50}" dictionary as the
       per_experience_classes parameter. Defaults to None.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp: If True, original class IDs
       will be remapped so that they will appear as having an ascending
       order. For instance, if the resulting class order after shuffling
       (or defined by fixed_class_order) is [23, 34, 11, 7, 6, ...] and
       class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp is True, then all the patterns
       belonging to class 23 will appear as belonging to class "0",
       class "34" will be mapped to "1", class "11" to "2" and so on.
       This is very useful when drawing confusion matrices and when dealing
       with algorithms with dynamic head expansion. Defaults to False.
       Mutually exclusive with the ``class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp``
       parameter.
   :param class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp: If True, original class IDs
       will be mapped to range [0, n_classes_in_step) for each step.
       Defaults to False. Mutually exclusive with the
       ``class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp parameter``.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides all the other
       scenario definition options. This is usually a dictionary containing
       data used to reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.

   .. attribute:: classes_order
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      Stores the class order (remapped class IDs). 


   .. attribute:: classes_order_original_ids
      :annotation: :List[int]

      Stores the class order (original class IDs) 


   .. attribute:: class_mapping
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      class_mapping stores the class mapping so that 
      `mapped_class_id = class_mapping[original_class_id]`. 

      If the scenario is created with an amount of classes which is less than
      the amount of all classes in the dataset, then class_mapping will 
      contain some -1 values corresponding to ignored classes. This can
      happen when passing a fixed class order to the constructor.


   .. attribute:: n_classes_per_exp
      :annotation: :List[int] = []

      A list that, for each step (identified by its index/ID),
      stores the number of classes assigned to that step. 


   .. attribute:: original_classes_in_exp
      :annotation: :List[Set[int]] = []

      A list that, for each step (identified by its index/ID),
      stores a list of the original IDs of classes assigned 
      to that step. 


   .. attribute:: class_ids_from_zero_from_first_exp
      :annotation: :bool

      If True the class IDs have been remapped to start from zero. 


   .. attribute:: class_ids_from_zero_in_each_exp

      each step 


   .. attribute:: n_classes
      :annotation: :int

      The number of classes 


   .. method:: classes_in_experience(self) -> Sequence[Set[int]]
      :property:

      A list that, for each experience (identified by its index/ID),
      stores a set of the (optionally remapped) IDs of classes of patterns
      assigned to that experience. 


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self)

      Gets the data needed to reproduce this experiment.

      This data can be stored using the pickle module or some other mechanism.
      It can then be loaded by passing it as the ``reproducibility_data``
      parameter in the constructor.

      Child classes should get the reproducibility dictionary from super class
      and then merge their custom data before returning it.

      :return: A dictionary containing the data needed to reproduce the
          experiment.


   .. method:: classes_in_exp_range(self, exp_start: int, exp_end: Optional[int] = None) -> List[int]

      Gets a list of classes contained in the given steps. The steps are
      defined by range. This means that only the classes in range
      [step_start, exp_end) will be included.

      :param exp_start: The starting step ID.
      :param exp_end: The final step ID. Can be None, which means that all
          the remaining steps will be taken.

      :returns: The classes contained in the required step range.



.. py:class:: NCExperience(origin_stream: GenericScenarioStream['NCExperience', NCScenario[TrainSet, TestSet]], current_experience: int)

   Bases: :class:`GenericExperience[NCScenario[TrainSet, TestSet], GenericScenarioStream['NCExperience', NCScenario[TrainSet, TestSet]]]`, :class:`Generic[TrainSet, TestSet]`

   Defines a "New Classes" step. It defines fields to obtain the current
   dataset and the associated task label. It also keeps a reference to the
   stream from which this step was taken.

   Creates a ``NCExperience`` instance given the stream from this
   step was taken and and the current step ID.

   :param origin_stream: The stream from which this step was obtained.
   :param current_experience: The current step ID, as an integer.


.. py:class:: NIScenario(train_dataset: TrainSet, test_dataset: TestSet, n_experiences: int, task_labels: bool = False, shuffle: bool = True, seed: Optional[int] = None, balance_experiences: bool = False, min_class_patterns_in_exp: int = 0, fixed_exp_assignment: Optional[Sequence[Sequence[int]]] = None, reproducibility_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)

   Bases: :class:`GenericCLScenario[TrainSet, TestSet, 'NIExperience']`, :class:`Generic[TrainSet, TestSet]`

   This class defines a "New Instance" scenario.
   Once created, an instance of this class can be iterated in order to obtain
   the step sequence under the form of instances of :class:`NIExperience`.

   Instances of this class can be created using the constructor directly.
   However, we recommend using facilities like
   :func:`avalanche.benchmarks.generators.ni_scenario`.

   Consider that every method from :class:`NIExperience` used to retrieve
   parts of the test set (past, current, future, cumulative) always return the
   complete test set. That is, they behave as the getter for the complete test
   set.

   Creates a NIScenario instance given the training and test Datasets and
   the number of steps.

   :param train_dataset: The training dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``train_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param test_dataset: The test dataset. The dataset must be a
       subclass of :class:`AvalancheDataset`. For instance, one can
       use the datasets from the torchvision package like that:
       ``test_dataset=AvalancheDataset(torchvision_dataset)``.
   :param n_experiences: The number of steps.
   :param task_labels: If True, each step will have an ascending task
       label. If False, the task label will be 0 for all the steps.
       Defaults to False.
   :param shuffle: If True, the patterns order will be shuffled. Defaults
       to True.
   :param seed: If shuffle is True and seed is not None, the class order
       will be shuffled according to the seed. When None, the current
       PyTorch random number generator state will be used.
       Defaults to None.
   :param balance_experiences: If True, pattern of each class will be
       equally spread across all steps. If False, patterns will be assigned
       to steps in a complete random way. Defaults to False.
   :param min_class_patterns_in_exp: The minimum amount of patterns of
       every class that must be assigned to every step. Compatible with
       the ``balance_experiences`` parameter. An exception will be raised
       if this constraint can't be satisfied. Defaults to 0.
   :param fixed_exp_assignment: If not None, the pattern assignment
       to use. It must be a list with an entry for each step. Each entry
       is a list that contains the indexes of patterns belonging to that
       step. Overrides the ``shuffle``, ``balance_experiences`` and
       ``min_class_patterns_in_exp`` parameters.
   :param reproducibility_data: If not None, overrides all the other
       scenario definition options, including ``fixed_exp_assignment``.
       This is usually a dictionary containing data used to
       reproduce a specific experiment. One can use the
       ``get_reproducibility_data`` method to get (and even distribute)
       the experiment setup so that it can be loaded by passing it as this
       parameter. In this way one can be sure that the same specific
       experimental setup is being used (for reproducibility purposes).
       Beware that, in order to reproduce an experiment, the same train and
       test datasets must be used. Defaults to None.

   .. method:: classes_in_experience(self) -> Sequence[Set[int]]
      :property:

      A list that, for each experience (identified by its index/ID),
      stores a set of the (optionally remapped) IDs of classes of patterns
      assigned to that experience. 


   .. method:: get_reproducibility_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]

   Defines a "New Instances" step. It defines fields to obtain the current
   dataset and the associated task label. It also keeps a reference to the
   stream from which this step was taken.

   Creates a ``NIExperience`` instance given the stream from this
   step was taken and and the current step ID.
