.. function:: default_image_loader(path)

   Sets the default image loader for the Pytorch Dataset.

   :param path: relative or absolute path of the file to load.

   :returns: Returns the image as a RGB PIL image.


.. function:: default_flist_reader(flist, root)

   This reader reads a filelist and return a list of paths.

   :param flist: path of the flislist to read. The flist format should be:
       impath label, impath label,  ...(same to caffe's filelist)
   :param root: path to the dataset root. Each file defined in the file list
       will be searched in <root>/<impath>.

   :returns: Returns a list of paths (the examples to be loaded).


.. py:class:: PathsDataset(root, files, transform=None, target_transform=None, loader=default_image_loader)

   Bases: :class:`torch.utils.data.Dataset`

   This class extends the basic Pytorch Dataset class to handle list of paths
   as the main data source.

   Creates a File Dataset from a list of files and labels.

   :param root: root path where the data to load are stored. May be None.
   :param files: list of tuples. Each tuple must contain two elements: the
       full path to the pattern and its class label. Optionally, the tuple
       may contain a third element describing the bounding box to use for
       cropping (top, left, height, width).
   :param transform: eventual transformation to add to the input data (x)
   :param target_transform: eventual transformation to add to the targets
       (y)
   :param loader: loader function to use (for the real data) given path.

   .. method:: __getitem__(self, index)

      Returns next element in the dataset given the current index.

      :param index: index of the data to get.
      :return: loaded item.


   .. method:: __len__(self)

      Returns the total number of elements in the dataset.

      :return: Total number of dataset items.



.. py:class:: FilelistDataset(root, flist, transform=None, target_transform=None, flist_reader=default_flist_reader, loader=default_image_loader)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.benchmarks.utils.datasets_from_filelists.PathsDataset`

   This class extends the basic Pytorch Dataset class to handle filelists as
   main data source.

           This reader reads a filelist and return a list of paths.

           :param root: root path where the data to load are stored. May be None.
           :param flist: path of the flislist to read. The flist format should be:
               impath label
   impath label
    ...(same to caffe's filelist).
           :param transform: eventual transformation to add to the input data (x).
           :param target_transform: eventual transformation to add to the targets
               (y).
           :param flist_reader: loader function to use (for the filelists) given
               path.
           :param loader: loader function to use (for the real data) given path.
           


.. function:: datasets_from_filelists(root, train_filelists, test_filelists, complete_test_set_only=False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None)

   This reader reads a list of Caffe-style filelists and returns the proper
   Dataset objects.

   A Caffe-style list is just a text file where, for each line, two elements
   are described: the path to the pattern (relative to the root parameter)
   and its class label. Those two elements are separated by a single white
   space.

   This method reads each file list and returns a separate
   dataset for each of them.

   Beware that the parameters must be **list of paths to Caffe-style
   filelists**. If you need to create a dataset given a list of
   **pattern paths**, use `datasets_from_paths` instead.

   :param root: root path where the data to load are stored. May be None.
   :param train_filelists: list of paths to train filelists. The flist format
       should be: impath label\nimpath label\n ...(same to Caffe's filelist).
   :param test_filelists: list of paths to test filelists. It can be also a
       single path when the datasets is the same for each batch.
   :param complete_test_set_only: if True, test_filelists must contain
       the path to a single filelist that will serve as the complete test set.
       Alternatively, test_filelists can be the path (str) to the complete test
       set filelist. If False, train_filelists and test_filelists must contain
       the same amount of filelists paths. Defaults to False.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

   :return: list of tuples (train dataset, test dataset) for each train
       filelist in the list.


.. function:: datasets_from_paths(train_list, test_list, complete_test_set_only=False, train_transform=None, train_target_transform=None, test_transform=None, test_target_transform=None)

   This utility takes, for each dataset to generate, a list of tuples each
   containing two elements: the full path to the pattern and its class label.
   Optionally, the tuple may contain a third element describing the bounding
   box to use for cropping.

   This is equivalent to `datasets_from_filelists`, which description
   contains more details on the behaviour of this utility. The two utilities
   differ in which `datasets_from_filelists` accepts paths to Caffe-style
   filelists while this one is able to create the datasets from an in-memory
   list.

   Note: this utility may try to detect (and strip) the common root path of
   all patterns in order to save some RAM memory.

   :param train_list: list of lists. Each list must contain tuples of two
       elements: the full path to the pattern and its class label. Optionally,
       the tuple may contain a third element describing the bounding box to use
       for cropping (top, left, height, width).
   :param test_list: list of lists. Each list must contain tuples of two
       elements: the full path to the pattern and its class label. Optionally,
       the tuple may contain a third element describing the bounding box to use
       for cropping (top, left, height, width). It can be also a single list
       when the test dataset is the same for each step.
   :param complete_test_set_only: if True, test_list must contain a single list
       that will serve as the complete test set. If False, train_list and
       test_list must describe the same amount of datasets. Defaults to False.
   :param train_transform: The transformation to apply to training patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param train_target_transform: The transformation to apply to training
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.
   :param test_transform: The transformation to apply to test patterns.
       Defaults to None.
   :param test_target_transform: The transformation to apply to test
       patterns targets. Defaults to None.

   :return: A list of tuples (train dataset, test dataset).
