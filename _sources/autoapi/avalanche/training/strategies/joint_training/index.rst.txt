.. py:class:: JointTraining(model: Module, optimizer: Optimizer, criterion, train_mb_size: int = 1, train_epochs: int = 1, eval_mb_size: int = 1, device='cpu', plugins: Optional[Sequence['StrategyPlugin']] = None, evaluator=default_logger)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.strategies.BaseStrategy`

   JointTraining performs joint training (also called offline training) on
   the entire stream of data. This means that it is not a continual
   learning strategy but it can be used as an "offline" upper bound for
   them.

   .. warnings also::
       Currently :py:class:`JointTraining` adapts its own dataset.
       Please check that the plugins you are using do not implement
       :py:meth:`adapt_trainin_dataset`. Otherwise, they are incompatible
       with :py:class:`JointTraining`.

   :param model: PyTorch model.
   :param optimizer: PyTorch optimizer.
   :param criterion: loss function.
   :param train_mb_size: mini-batch size for training.
   :param train_epochs: number of training epochs.
   :param eval_mb_size: mini-batch size for eval.
   :param device: PyTorch device to run the model.
   :param plugins: (optional) list of StrategyPlugins.
   :param evaluator: (optional) instance of EvaluationPlugin for logging
       and metric computations. None to remove logging.

   .. method:: train(self, experiences: Union[Experience, Sequence[Experience]], eval_streams: Optional[Sequence[Union[Experience, Sequence[Experience]]]] = None, **kwargs)

      Training loop. if experiences is a single element trains on it.
      If it is a sequence, trains the model on each experience in order.
      This is different from joint training on the entire stream.
      It returns a dictionary with last recorded value for each metric.

      :param experiences: single Experience or sequence.
      :param eval_streams: list of streams for evaluation.
          If None: use training experiences for evaluation.
          Use [] if you do not want to evaluate during training.

      :return: dictionary containing last recorded value for
          each metric name.


   .. method:: train_dataset_adaptation(self, **kwargs)

      Concatenates all the datastream.
