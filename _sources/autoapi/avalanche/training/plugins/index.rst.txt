=================================

.. py:module:: avalanche.training.plugins

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Plugins allow to add custom behavior at specific points of the train/eval loops.
   For example, :py:meth:`before_training_exp` can be used to adapt the model
   before training on a new experience. Similarly, other methods allow to
   completely customize the training loop to easily implement any strategy.

   Plugins are used by strategies (e.g., the :py:class:`BaseStrategy`) by calling
   each method at the correct point of the train/eval loops and they can be
   easily combined together to create custom strategies.

.. py:class:: ReplayPlugin(mem_size=200)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Experience replay plugin.

   Handles an external memory filled with randomly selected
   patterns and implements the "adapt_train_dataset" callback to add them to
   the training set.

   The :mem_size: attribute controls the number of patterns to be stored in 
   the external memory. In multitask scenarios, mem_size is the memory size
   for each task. We assume the training set contains at least :mem_size: data
   points.

   .. method:: adapt_train_dataset(self, strategy, **kwargs)

      Expands the current training set with datapoint from
      the external memory before training.


   .. method:: after_training_exp(self, strategy, **kwargs)

      After training we update the external memory with the patterns of
      the current training batch/task. 



.. py:class:: GDumbPlugin(mem_size=200)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   A GDumb plugin. At each experience the model
   is trained with all and only the data of the external memory.
   The memory is updated at the end of each experience to add new classes or
   new examples of already encountered classes.
   In multitask scenarios, mem_size is the memory size for each task.

   This plugin can be combined with a Naive strategy to obtain the
   standard GDumb strategy.

   https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/publications/2020/gdumb.pdf

   .. method:: adapt_train_dataset(self, strategy, **kwargs)

      Before training we make sure to organize the memory following
      GDumb approach and updating the dataset accordingly.



.. py:class:: EvaluationPlugin(*metrics: Union['PluginMetric', Sequence['PluginMetric']], loggers: Union['StrategyLogger', Sequence['StrategyLogger']] = None, collect_all=True)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   An evaluation plugin that obtains relevant data from the
   training and eval loops of the strategy through callbacks.

   This plugin updates the given metrics and logs them using the provided
   loggers.

   Creates an instance of the evaluation plugin.

   :param metrics: The metrics to compute.
   :param loggers: The loggers to be used to log the metric values.
   :param collect_curves (bool): enables the collection of the metric
       curves. If True `self.metric_curves` stores all the values of
       each curve in a dictionary. Please disable this if you log large
       values (embeddings, parameters) and you want to reduce memory usage.

.. py:class:: CWRStarPlugin(model, cwr_layer_name=None, freeze_remaining_model=True)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Base class for strategy plugins. Implements all the callbacks required
   by the BaseStrategy with an empty function. Subclasses must override
   the callbacks.

   CWR* Strategy.
   This plugin does not use task identities.

   :param model: the model.
   :param cwr_layer_name: name of the last fully connected layer. Defaults
       to None, which means that the plugin will attempt an automatic
       detection.
   :param freeze_remaining_model: If True, the plugin will freeze (set
       layers in eval mode and disable autograd for parameters) all the
       model except the cwr layer. Defaults to True.

   .. method:: after_training_exp(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: before_training_exp(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: consolidate_weights(self)

      Mean-shift for the target layer weights


   .. method:: set_consolidate_weights(self)

      set trained weights 


   .. method:: reset_weights(self, cur_clas)

      reset weights


   .. method:: get_cwr_layer(self) -> Optional[Linear]


   .. method:: freeze_other_layers(self)



.. py:class:: MultiHeadPlugin(model, classifier_field: str = 'classifier', keep_initial_layer=False)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Base class for strategy plugins. Implements all the callbacks required
   by the BaseStrategy with an empty function. Subclasses must override
   the callbacks.

   MultiHeadPlugin manages a multi-head readout for multi-task
   scenarios and single-head adaptation for incremental tasks.
   The plugin automatically set the correct output head when the task
   changes and adds new heads when a novel task is encountered.
   This plugin *needs task identities* for multi-task scenarios.
   It does not need task identities for single incremental tasks
   (e.g. class incremental).

   By default, a Linear (fully connected) layer is created
   with as many output units as the number of classes in that task. This
   behaviour can be changed by overriding the "create_task_layer" method.

   By default, weights are initialized using the Linear class default
   initialization. This behaviour can be changed by overriding the
   "initialize_new_task_layer" method.

   When dealing with a Single-Incremental-Task scenario, the final layer
   may get dynamically expanded. By default, the initialization provided by
   the Linear class is used and then weights of already existing classes
   are copied (that  is, without adapting the weights of new classes).
   The user can control how the new weights are initialized by overriding
   "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head".

   :param model: PyTorch model
   :param classifier_field: field of the last layer of model.
   :param keep_initial_layer: if True keeps the initial layer for task 0.

   .. method:: before_training_iteration(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: before_eval_iteration(self, strategy, **kwargs)


   .. method:: set_task_layer(self, strategy, experience: Experience)

      Sets the correct task layer. Creates a new head for previously
      unseen tasks.

      :param strategy: the CL strategy.
      :param experience: the experience info object.
      :return: None


   .. method:: create_task_layer(self, n_output_units: int, previous_task_layer=None)

      Creates a new task layer.

      By default, this method will create a new :class:`Linear` layer with
      n_output_units" output units. If  "previous_task_layer" is None,
      the name of the classifier field is used to retrieve the amount of
      input features.

      This method will also be used to create a new layer when expanding
      an existing task head.

      This method can be overridden by the user so that a layer different
      from :class:`Linear` can be created.

      :param n_output_units: The number of output units.
      :param previous_task_layer: If not None, the previously created layer
           for the same task.
      :return: The new layer.


   .. method:: initialize_new_task_layer(self, new_layer: Module)

      Initializes a new head.

      This usually is just a weight initialization procedure, but more
      complex operations can be done as well.

      The head can be either a new layer created for a previously
      unseen task or a layer created to expand an existing task layer. In the
      latter case, the user can define a specific weight initialization
      procedure for the expanded part of the head by overriding the
      "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head" method.

      By default, if no custom implementation is provided, no specific
      initialization is done, which means that the default initialization
      provided by the :class:`Linear` class is used.

      :param new_layer: The new layer to adapt.
      :return: None


   .. method:: initialize_dynamically_expanded_head(self, prev_task_layer, new_task_layer)

      Initializes head weights for enw classes.

      This function is called by "adapt_task_layer" only.

      Defaults to no-op, which uses the initialization provided
      by "initialize_new_task_layer" (already called by "adapt_task_layer").

      This method should initialize the weights for new classes. However,
      if the strategy dictates it, this may be the perfect place to adapt
      weights of previous classes, too.

      :param prev_task_layer: New previous, not expanded, task layer.
      :param new_task_layer: The new task layer, with weights from already
          existing classes already set.
      :return:


   .. method:: adapt_task_layer(self, prev_task_layer, new_task_layer)

      Adapts the task layer by copying previous weights to the new layer and
      by calling "initialize_dynamically_expanded_head".

      This method is called by "expand_task_layer" only if a new task layer
      was created as the result of encountering a new class for that task.

      :param prev_task_layer: The previous task later.
      :param new_task_layer: The new task layer.
      :return: None.


   .. method:: expand_task_layer(self, strategy, min_n_output_units: int, task_layer)

      Expands an existing task layer.

      This method checks if the layer for a task should be expanded to
      accommodate for "min_n_output_units" output units. If the task layer
      already contains a sufficient amount of output units, no operations are
      done and "task_layer" will be returned as-is.

      If an expansion is needed, "create_task_layer" will be used to create
      a new layer and then "adapt_task_layer" will be called to copy the
      weights of already seen classes and to initialize the weights
      for the expanded part of the layer.

      :param strategy: CL strategy.
      :param min_n_output_units: The number of required output units.
      :param task_layer: The previous task layer.

      :return: The new layer for the task.



.. py:class:: LwFPlugin(alpha=1, temperature=2)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

.. py:class:: AGEMPlugin(patterns_per_experience: int, sample_size: int)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Average Gradient Episodic Memory Plugin.
   AGEM projects the gradient on the current minibatch by using an external
   episodic memory of patterns from previous experiences. If the dot product
   between the current gradient and the (average) gradient of a randomly
   sampled set of memory examples is negative, the gradient is projected.
   This plugin does not use task identities.

   :param patterns_per_experience: number of patterns per experience in the
       memory.
   :param sample_size: number of patterns in memory sample when computing
       reference gradient.

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Gradient Episodic Memory Plugin.
   GEM projects the gradient on the current minibatch by using an external
   episodic memory of patterns from previous experiences. The gradient on
   the current minibatch is projected so that the dot product with all the
   reference gradients of previous tasks remains positive.
   This plugin does not use task identities.

   :param patterns_per_experience: number of patterns per experience in the
       memory.
   :param memory_strength: offset to add to the projection direction
       in order to favour backward transfer (gamma in original paper).

.. py:class:: EWCPlugin(ewc_lambda, mode='separate', decay_factor=None, keep_importance_data=False)

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) plugin.
   EWC computes importance of each weight at the end of training on current
   experience. During training on each minibatch, the loss is augmented
   with a penalty which keeps the value of the current weights close to the
   value they had on previous experiences in proportion to their importance
   on that experience. Importances are computed with an additional pass on the
   training set. This plugin does not use task identities.

   :param ewc_lambda: hyperparameter to weigh the penalty inside the total
          loss. The larger the lambda, the larger the regularization.
   :param mode: `separate` to keep a separate penalty for each previous 
          experience.
          `online` to keep a single penalty summed with a decay factor 
          over all previous tasks.
   :param decay_factor: used only if mode is `online`. 
          It specifies the decay term of the importance matrix.
   :param keep_importance_data: if True, keep in memory both parameter
           values and importances for all previous task, for all modes.
           If False, keep only last parameter values and importances.
           If mode is `separate`, the value of `keep_importance_data` is
           set to be True.

   .. method:: before_backward(self, strategy, **kwargs)

      Compute EWC penalty and add it to the loss.

      importances.



.. py:class:: SynapticIntelligencePlugin(si_lambda: float, excluded_parameters: Sequence['str'] = None, device: Any = 'as_strategy')

   Bases: :class:`avalanche.training.plugins.StrategyPlugin`

   The Synaptic Intelligence plugin.

   This is the Synaptic Intelligence PyTorch implementation of the
   algorithm described in the paper "Continual Learning Through Synaptic
   Intelligence" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04200).

   This plugin can be attached to existing strategies to achieve a
   regularization effect.

   This plugin will require the strategy `loss` field to be set before the
   `before_backward` callback is invoked. The loss Tensor will be updated to
   achieve the S.I. regularization effect.

   Creates an instance of the Synaptic Intelligence plugin.

   :param si_lambda: Synaptic Intelligence lambda term.
   :param device: The device to use to run the S.I. experiences.
       Defaults to "as_strategy", which means that the `device` field of
       the strategy will be used. Using a different device may lead to a
       performance drop due to the required data transfer.

   .. attribute:: ewc_data
      :annotation: :EwcDataType

      The first dictionary contains the params at loss minimum while the 
      second one contains the parameter importance.
